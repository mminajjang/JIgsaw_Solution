# Jigsaw puzzle Solver

This project aims to develop an algorithm that combines image processing and robotics to recognize and automatically and robotics to recognize and automatically assemble given puzzle pieces. Key features include detecting and matching puzzle piece shapes to assemble the complete puzzle. If focuses on automating the puzzle assembly process by using image processing techniques and the potential of collaborative robotics.

This repository focuses on developing an algorithm for solving puzzles through image processing and for assembling them.
